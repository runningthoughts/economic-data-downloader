A Python CLI tool that fetches daily closing data for DJIA, S&P 500, and NASDAQ over a given date range and saves it to CSV.

### Setting up the Virtual Environment

First, ensure you have the required packages for creating virtual environments:

```bash
# On Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install python3-venv

# On other systems, the venv module might be included by default
```

Then create and activate the virtual environment:

```bash
cd economic-data
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate.bat       # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```bash
python fetch_market_data.py --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-12-31 --out djia_sp500_nasdaq.csv
```

Command line arguments:
- `--start`: Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format (default: 2024-01-01)
- `--end`: End date in YYYY-MM-DD format (default: today)
- `--out`: Output CSV file path (default: market_data.csv)

### Future Extensions

The market data tool is designed for easy extension:
- Add support for fetching additional market symbols
- Implement data visualization and plotting
- Integrate with other economic indicators
- Add data transformation and analysis capabilities

## Dependencies

- streamlit
- pandas
